-2 ¼ teaspoons active dry yeast
-¼ cup warm water
-1 cup lukewarm milk
-2 tablespoon unsalted butter at room temperature
-½ cup sugar
-1 teaspoon salt
-2 eggs, beaten
-4 ½ cups all purpose flour or more as necessary

Directions:
1). Dissolve the yeast in ¼ cup warm water in a big bowl. Let stand for 10 minutes, and then stir well.

2). In a bowl, combine milk, butter, eggs, sugar and salt.

3). Add milk mixture and 2 cups flour into the yeast mixture. Beat with a wooden spoon or electric mixer until smooth. Gradually stir in remaining flour, adding more if necessary.

7). Cover with a cloth and let rise for at least one hour or until almost double in size.

8). Bake in 225 degree F oven for 20 minutes and then increase the oven temperature to 325 degrees. Bake for another 10-15 minutes or until golden brown.

9). Serve and enjoy!
